# mastermind_pair

This is a collaboration between [Robert Suazo](https://github.com/rsuazo) and [Michael Marchand](https://github.com/marchandmd)

We're building a Mastermind Game similar to the one found [here as part of The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop#project-2-mastermind)

## 1/6/2020:
1. created 'lib/' directory
2. moved 'mastermind_pair.rb' into `lib/`
2. initialized 'rspec'
